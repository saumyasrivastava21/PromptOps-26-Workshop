# 🚀 PromptOps'26 — From Prompts to Production Systems

From prompts to production — building real AI systems, not just learning them.

PromptOps’26 was a 3-day intensive hands-on workshop organized by the Computer Society of Software Engineers (CSSE) at Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology.

## 📌 Overview

PromptOps’26 focused on engineering with AI — not just using AI tools.

Participants learned and built:

- Structured Prompt Engineering workflows
- Real-time Face Detection using OpenCV (Res10 SSD Model)
- AI-assisted web development using Cursor AI
- Production-grade deployment using Vercel

Complete lifecycle covered:

Prompting → Development → Deployment
